# Actuals Upload Page Refactor: Summary & Best Practices

## Overview

The `ActualsUploadPage.tsx` component is a large, business-critical React component. The project goal is to improve maintainability by breaking it into smaller components and hooks **without changing the UI/UX, layout, or user experience in any way**.

## The Wrapper Approach

To guarantee the UI/UX remains unchanged during refactor:
- The file `index.tsx` in the `ActualsUploadPage` directory simply imports and renders the original `ActualsUploadPage.tsx` component.
- This ensures that, regardless of ongoing refactor work, the rendered output is always identical to the original.

## Why This Matters
- Users are highly sensitive to changes in this page's layout and workflow.
- Refactoring should never introduce visual or behavioral changes unless explicitly requested.
- This approach allows for safe, incremental improvements and easy rollback if needed.

## Step-by-Step Refactor Template

1. **Start with the Wrapper**
   - Ensure `index.tsx` only renders the original component.
2. **Extract a Small Piece**
   - Identify a section, logic block, or UI element to extract.
   - Move it to a new file (component or hook).
   - Import and use it in the original file.
3. **Test Visually**
   - Build and run the app.
   - Confirm the UI/UX is pixel-perfect to the original.
4. **Commit and Document**
   - Use clear commit messages and update documentation if needed.
5. **Repeat**
   - Continue extracting and testing, one piece at a time.

## Best Practices
- **Never change the UI/UX or layout during refactor.**
- **Always test visually after each change.**
- **If a change alters the output, revert and try a smaller extraction.**
- **Document your steps and update this summary as needed.**

## Conclusion

This process ensures the codebase becomes more maintainable and modular, while the user experience remains stable and familiar. Cursor AI Agents and developers should follow this template for all future refactor work on the Actuals Upload Page.
