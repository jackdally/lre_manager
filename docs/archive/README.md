# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded by newer, more organized systems.

## TODO-LEGACY.md

**Status**: Archived (Superseded by new task management system)  
**Date Archived**: [Current Date]  
**Reason**: Replaced by organized task management system in `docs/tasks/`

### What Happened to TODO.md?

The original `TODO.md` file was moved here and renamed to `TODO-LEGACY.md` because:

1. **Poor Organization** - Mixed high-level features with detailed tasks
2. **Inconsistent Structure** - No clear priority or categorization
3. **Maintenance Issues** - Hard to find and update specific tasks
4. **Redundant Information** - Many completed tasks that are now archived elsewhere
5. **Better Alternative** - New organized task management system in `docs/tasks/`

### Migration Summary

**Active tasks were migrated to:**
- **Bug fixes**: `docs/tasks/active/bugs.md`
- **General tasks**: `docs/tasks/active/general.md`
- **Feature-specific tasks**: `docs/tasks/active/` (by feature name)

**Completed tasks were archived in:**
- `docs/tasks/completed/` (by feature name)
- `docs/implementation-plans/archive/2025/Q3/` (implementation plans)

### New Task Management System

The new system provides:
- ✅ **Better Organization** - Tasks grouped by category and feature
- ✅ **Clear Status Tracking** - Easy to see active vs completed work
- ✅ **Scalability** - Can handle hundreds of tasks across many features
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for each feature's tasks
- ✅ **Archiving** - Natural lifecycle management for completed work

### How to Use the New System

1. **Active Tasks**: `docs/tasks/active/`
2. **Completed Tasks**: `docs/tasks/completed/`
3. **Task Management**: `docs/tasks/README.md`
4. **Helper Scripts**: `scripts/task-management.sh`

### Legacy TODO Content

The original TODO.md contained:
- **136 lines** of mixed task types
- **Completed tasks** from Q3 2025 features
- **Active bugs** and general improvements
- **Feature implementation plans** (now in dedicated files)

All active content has been migrated to the appropriate new locations.
