# Git Branch Strategy

## Branch Structure

### `main` (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code only
- **Protection**: Should only receive merges from `develop` after code review and testing
- **Status**: Stable, tested, and ready for deployment

### `develop` (Development)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for all new features and fixes
- **Workflow**: All development work happens here
- **Status**: Latest development code, may be unstable

## Development Workflow

### For New Features/Fixes

1. **Create feature branch from develop**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Work on your feature**:
   - Make commits as you work
   - Keep commits focused and meaningful
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Push to remote early for backup: `git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name`

3. **Keep feature branch updated** (do this regularly):
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge develop  # or git rebase develop
   ```

4. **When feature is complete**:
   ```bash
   # Final sync with develop
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge develop
   
   # Merge to develop
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin develop
   
   # Clean up
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **When develop is ready for production**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge develop
   git push origin main
   git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release version 1.x.x"
   ```

**📖 See [FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed workflow and best practices.**

### For Hotfixes (critical production issues)

1. **Create hotfix from main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/fix-name
   ```

2. **Fix the issue and merge to both**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/fix-name
   git push origin main
   
   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/fix-name
   git push origin develop
   ```

## Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature branches**: `feature/feature-name` (e.g., `feature/boe-approval-workflow`)
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-description` (e.g., `fix/vendor-upload-error`)
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/critical-fix` (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- **Development**: `develop` (always lowercase)

## Best Practices

1. ✅ Always start from `develop` when creating new feature branches
2. ✅ Keep `main` clean - only merge tested, reviewed code
3. ✅ Regularly sync `develop` with `main` to avoid large merges
4. ✅ Delete merged feature branches to keep repository clean
5. ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
6. ✅ Test thoroughly before merging to `develop`
7. ✅ Code review before merging `develop` → `main`

## Current Status

- **Main**: Stable, includes vendor upload fix and all BOE wizard improvements
- **Develop**: Created from main, ready for new BOE development work
