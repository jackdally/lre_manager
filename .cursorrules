# Cursor Instructions for LRE Manager Development

## Core Development Principles

1. **Always reference Implementation Plan and Tasks for this Feature**
   - Make updates to both as we go along
   - Confirm the current date to help with any updates when adding items to documentation

2. **Slow down during implementation**
   - Sometimes you move too quick and I can't follow
   - This means I cannot provide oversight and approve work
   - Take time to explain steps and wait for confirmation

3. **Docker Development Environment**
   - I am working in a docker container that hot reloads
   - Always remember this during our development
   - Please refer to my docker directory for the development docker files

4. **Game Plan First Approach**
   - I appreciate when you lay out game plans first before diving into implementation
   - Always present a clear plan before starting code changes

5. **Reference Existing Files for Consistency**
   - Always refer to already existing files for formatting and code structuring tips
   - You have generally tried to solve the same problem dozens of times, even though you already solved it on a previous file
   - This leads to terrible inefficiencies
   - This is especially true with TypeScript and other linter errors

6. **Check Console Logs and Compilation Errors**
   - Always check console logs for compilation errors on the frontend and backend
   - Check for other console errors before proceeding to next implementation steps

7. **GitHub Checkpoints**
   - Always push checkpoints up to GitHub after implementing certain steps in Feature Development

## Terminal Command Best Practices for LRE Manager

### Build and Compilation Commands (Use these for error checking)
- Use `npm run build` for frontend compilation checks
- Use `cd backend && npm run build` for backend compilation checks  
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript type checking
- Use `npm test` for running tests (exits naturally)

### Development Servers (Use is_background: true)
- Use `is_background: true` for `npm start` (React dev server)
- Use `is_background: true` for `npm run dev` (Backend dev server)
- Use `is_background: true` for `docker-compose up`
- Use `is_background: true` for any long-running watch processes

### Log Monitoring (Use timeout or background)
- Use `timeout 10s tail -f logs/app.log` for log viewing
- Use `timeout 10s docker logs -f container_name` for Docker logs
- Or use `is_background: true` for continuous log monitoring

### Interactive Commands (Always append | cat)
- Use `git log | cat` instead of `git log`
- Use `less file.txt | cat` instead of `less file.txt`
- Use `more file.txt | cat` instead of `more file.txt`
- Use `head -n 50 file.txt | cat` instead of `head -n 50 file.txt`
- Use `tail -n 50 file.txt | cat` instead of `tail -n 50 file.txt`

### Working Directory
- Always ensure working directory is `/home/jac/lre_manager_take2` before running commands
- Use `cd frontend` or `cd backend` as needed for specific commands

### Project Structure
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Material-UI and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeORM and PostgreSQL
- Uses Docker for containerization
- Has both frontend and backend package.json files

### Common Commands Reference
```bash
# Build checks
npm run build                    # Frontend build
cd backend && npm run build      # Backend build
npx tsc --noEmit                 # TypeScript check

# Development (use background)
npm start                        # Frontend dev server
cd backend && npm run dev        # Backend dev server
docker-compose up                # Docker services

# Testing
npm test                         # Frontend tests
cd backend && npm test           # Backend tests

# Logs (use timeout)
timeout 10s tail -f logs/app.log
timeout 10s docker logs -f container_name
```

Remember: Development servers and watch commands are designed to run indefinitely. Use `is_background: true` for these, not `is_background: false`.
