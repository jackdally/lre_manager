-- This script is no longer needed since we don't store WBS template references in programs
-- WBS templates are now copied to program WBS categories during program creation
-- and then the template reference is not stored

-- The WBS template selection during program creation is handled by the backend service
-- which copies the template elements to the program's WBS categories and subcategories

-- No database changes are needed for this approach
